## Download

This app can be downloaded from [our repo](http://repo.enonic.com/public/com/enonic/app/google.tagmanager/), or you can download the source code and build the app yourself.

## Configuration

Just add the app to your site. The only configuration required is setting the Container ID for Google Tag Manager.

## Notes

The snippet will only be added to your site in "live" mode. In other words, when you edit or preview your site, Google Tag Manager will not be enabled.
